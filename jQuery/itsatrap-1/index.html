    <!-- we're including the JavaScript at the bottom of the page. We can assume that all this DOM here has been already loaded. 
        Now this way of including JavaScript at the bottom of the page is a best practice. Because it speeds up the users experience.
        It doesn't need to wait for anything. It's slightly faster than on ready and it allows other things like images and such 
        to download before your JavaScript files download-->
